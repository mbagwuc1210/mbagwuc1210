This project aims to curate a recipe recommendation system that aids users in cooking dishes based on the ingredients they have on hand in their homes. Users will input a list of ingredients, and the system will use a simple matching algorithm to filter recipes that can be made using those ingredients. For recipes requiring one or two missing ingredients, PantryPal will provide suitable substitutes or alternative recipes with similar ingredients. This tool will help users make the most of their ingredients, reduce food waste, and simplify meal planning.
